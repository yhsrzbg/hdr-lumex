# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # install deps (Node 18+; CI builds with Node 22)
npm start          # launch the Electron app from source (electron .)
npm run build      # build the portable executable into dist/ (electron-builder)
npm run build:win  # build for a single platform (also :mac, :linux)
```

There is no test runner, linter, or formatter configured. electron-builder cannot cross-compile, so cross-platform binaries are built per-runner in `.github/workflows/release.yml` (triggered by pushing a `v*` tag). The Windows target is `portable` (a single no-install `.exe`); mac is `dmg`, Linux is `AppImage`.

## Architecture

An Electron desktop app that decodes HDR (PQ/ST 2084) video, computes per-frame brightness and color-gamut stats, and renders an interactive chart in-window. Three-process layout:

- **`main.js`** (main process) — creates the single `BrowserWindow`, owns all IPC handlers: `select-video` (native open dialog), `start-analysis` (runs the analyzer with an `AbortController`, streams progress via `webContents.send('analysis-progress')`), `cancel-analysis`, `save-png`, `save-html`. Only one analysis runs at a time (`activeAbort` guard).
- **`preload.js`** — `contextBridge` exposes `window.hdrAPI` (contextIsolation on, nodeIntegration off). Resolves dropped-file paths via `webUtils.getPathForFile` with a fallback to `File.path` for older Electron.
- **`renderer.js` + `index.html`** — the UI. Three screens toggled by an `.active` class: drop/pick → progress (bar + cancel) → result (back + save PNG/HTML + chart canvas). `renderer.js` drives transitions and calls `window.drawChart`.

The analysis core is reused unchanged from the previous CLI version and is the part most worth reading before changing analysis behavior:

- **`src/analyze.js`** — spawns **ffprobe** for duration, then **ffmpeg** to decode at 1 fps into raw `gbrp10le` (10-bit planar, padded to 3840x2160) piped to stdout. Frames are reassembled from stdout chunks into a fixed-size buffer and processed inline in `processFrame`. The color science (PQ EOTF, Rec.2020→XYZ→CIE xy, barycentric gamut classification) lives here as pure functions. `analyze(videoPath, options, onProgress)` accepts `options.signal` (AbortSignal — kills the ffmpeg child, rejects with `'已取消'`) and optional `options.ffmpegPath`/`options.ffprobePath` overrides.
- **`src/report.js`** — `buildReportHtml(analysisData)` injects the analysis JSON + `assets/chart-renderer.js` into `src/report-template.html` by string replacement; used both for the in-app HTML export and the standalone report. `generateReport` writes it to disk.
- **`assets/chart-renderer.js`** — defines `window.drawChart(canvas, analysisData)`, the 3-panel Canvas 2D renderer. Loaded as a `<script>` in both `index.html` (live view) and the exported report. No native `canvas` dependency.

### FFmpeg binary resolution (important)

ffmpeg/ffprobe come from the `ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static` npm packages. Two runtime modes:

- **Dev** (`npm start`): `main.js`'s `resolveBinaries()` returns `{}`, so `analyze()` falls back to the package-provided paths (`src/ffmpeg-paths.js`).
- **Packaged**: electron-builder copies the binaries into `process.resourcesPath` (see `build.extraResources` in `package.json`, per-platform). `resolveBinaries()` points `analyze()` at those, and the bundled-but-unused npm copies are excluded from the asar via the `!**/node_modules/ffmpeg-static/...` patterns in `build.files`.

When adding any new bundled binary, update **both** `resolveBinaries()` in `main.js` **and** the per-platform `extraResources` in `package.json`.

`src/ffmpeg-paths.js` still contains SEA-detection logic from the prior single-executable build; it is now only exercised via its `ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static` fallback path (the dev mode), since the app is packaged with Electron rather than Node SEA.

## Conventions

- CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), `'use strict'`, Node core modules imported with the `node:` prefix.
- User-facing UI strings are in Chinese; keep that when editing menu/prompt/button text.
- The renderer runs under a strict CSP (`index.html` `<meta>` tag) with `script-src 'self'` — keep scripts in external files, no inline `<script>` with logic beyond loading.
